# Homework : 

On iOS, you'll want to use a UITableView (and work with UITableViewCells), while on Android, you will use a RecyclerView.  The way that you use them is similar on both platforms.
You'll create the table widget on the screen (Interface Builder, or the WYSIWYG in Android Studio), and then connect it to methods that tell the widget how many rows are in the table, and what is in each row.  The phone UI and code will handle the drawing, letting a user scroll through and select things.
Make a "grocery list" type app -- where you can add things to the list in the table, and remove them in some way.  The phones have different swiping and double tapping methods that work well -- dig in, and figure this out!  Once you know how to do things with a table, you'll have a good understanding of how almost everything else works on the phone APIs!

# The application idea : 

  I made a simple app that you can add and delete item from your list. You can slide the row to delete your items from the list
