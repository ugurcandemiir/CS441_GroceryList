# Homework : 

  Create a new class/view that can be placed on the screen, and use low-level primitives to draw on it.  Lines.  Text.  Images, Your choice; the goal is to get to a spot where you can comfortably put things on screen, and have some control over them.
Also have some support for animation and interaction -- drag things around, drag a line to draw, use a slider or a button to change things on the screen.

# The application idea : 
  I made a simple app that you can draw and clear the canvas. There is also undo button that you can clear your last movements.
